# Exploratory Analysis
To begin this exploratory analysis, first import libraries and define functions for plotting the data using Matplotlib. Depending on the data, not all plots will be made. Once you visualize the data as a graph(the graph file has attached as a PNG file), you will find each character of the channel.</br>

KPI Option1: day1_retention.
As you analyzed the data, you could see that Channel A, C, D, E, and F were not following KPI #1(day1 RR below 10%). On the other hand, channels B, and G are satisfied with the KPI so they need to be optimized.</br>

<img src="nru.png" width="400"></br>
KPI Option 2: NRU(New Registered Users).
You could see that Channel A, and B were not following KPI #2(nru below 30%). On the other hand, channels C, D, E, F, and G are satisfied with the KPI so they need to be optimized.

# Conclusion
<img src="Total_install_pie.png" width="400"> <img src="Total_install.png" width="400"></br>
Except for channel A, other channels B, C, D, E, F, and G are needed to be optimized following the KPI. It's around 76.7% of total installs. 
(Total_install_pie.png) In order to reduce this ratio, you would be better channel G with the most installs (number of cases) will be optimized first, followed by channels F, D, E, B, and C in order.

How to optimize the game app

It's an iOS game app raw data. It's included postback events which in-app game environment. You can get the real mobile game raw data!

I'd like to share the small dataset that you can practice how to optimize the mobile game using in-app data. I believe that it may help you to practice if you're just a beginner or never seen such a dataset before. You could simulate how to optimize the in-app game data. Which channel is good or bad.

Let's think about it if you are working at a game company and you are a game performance marketer which channel should be optimized ASAP? You could practice following the below KPI. Good Luck!

# Introduction
It's an iOS game app raw data. It's included postback events which in-app game environment. You can get the real mobile game raw data!

I'd like to share the small dataset that you can practice how to optimize the mobile game using in-app data. I believe that it may help you to practice if you're just a beginner or never seen such a dataset before. You could simulate how to optimize the in-app game data. Which channel is good or bad.

Let's think about it if you are working at a game company and you are a game performance marketer which channel should be optimized ASAP? You could practice following the below KPI. Good Luck!

# Exploratory Analysis
To begin this exploratory analysis, first import libraries and define functions for plotting the data using matplotlib. Depending on the data, not all plots will be made. Once you visualized the data as a graph(the graph file has attached as PNG file), you will find each character of channels.

KPI Option1 : day1_retention
As you analyzed the data, you could see the Channel A, C, D, E, F were not following KPI #1(day1 RR below 10%). On the other hand, the channel B, G are satisfied the KPI so that they need to be optimization

KPI Option 2 : NRU(New Registered Users)
You could see the Channel A, B were not following KPI #2(nru below 30%). On the other hand, the channel C, D, E, F, G are satisfied the KPI so that they need to be optimization

# Conclusion
Except for channel A, other channels B, C, D, E, F, G are needed to be optimized following the KPI. It's around 76.7% of total installs. It needs urgently optimize the channel if you are not rich. (joke) In order to reduce this ratio, you would be better
